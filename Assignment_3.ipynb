    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Modularity and Reusability:\n",
    "    Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable chunks of code. \n",
    "    Each function can perform a specific task, making your code modular and easier to understand.\n",
    "    Once defined, functions can be reused multiple times within the same program or in different programs, saving time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction:\n",
    "    Functions provide a level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a particular task. \n",
    "    Instead of having to understand how a task is performed at a low level,\n",
    "    other parts of the program can simply call the function, passing in any necessary parameters, and receive the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readability and Maintainability: \n",
    "    Using functions makes your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "    By giving meaningful names to functions, you can convey their purpose and make the code self-documenting. \n",
    "    Additionally, if a particular task needs to be modified or debugged, you only need to make changes within the function definition rather than searching through the entire program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Encapsulation: \n",
    "    Functions encapsulate specific functionality, meaning that changes made within a function do not affect other parts of the program unless explicitly designed to do so. \n",
    "    This helps in managing complexity and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  Code Organization:\n",
    "    Functions help in organizing code by grouping related tasks together. \n",
    "    This improves the overall structure of the program and makes it easier to navigate and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Code Reusability and Scalability:\n",
    "    Functions promote code reusability, which can save development time and effort, especially in larger projects.\n",
    "    Moreover, as the program grows, functions allow you to scale your codebase more efficiently by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units."

    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within a function runs when the function is called, not when it's specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a function in your program, you're essentially telling the computer what the function does and how it should behave when called. The actual execution of the code inside the function occurs only when the function is invoked or called during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following Python function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the code inside the `greet()` function will not execute until the function is called. You can call the function anywhere in your program like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greet()  # This line calls the greet function and prints \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, including Python, function is created using a specific syntax known as a \"function declaration\" or \"function definition.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you typically create a function in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    # Function body - code block defining what the function does\n",
    "    # It can contain any valid Python code\n",
    "    # You may use parameters to receive input values and return a result\n",
    "    # or perform some actions\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Return statement is optional. It's used to return a value back to the caller\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this syntax:\n",
    "- `def` is the keyword used to declare a function.\n",
    "- `function_name` is the name of the function. You can choose any valid name according to the naming conventions of the programming language you're using.\n",
    "- `parameters` are optional inputs that the function may take. These are variables that can be used inside the function.\n",
    "- The colon (`:`) signifies the beginning of the function's code block.\n",
    "- The function body consists of the code that defines what the function does. It can perform calculations, execute statements, or anything else that you want the function to do.\n",
    "- Optionally, the `return` statement is used to return a value from the function back to the caller. This statement is not required in all functions, especially those that are designed to perform actions without returning a result.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function and a function call are two related concepts in programming, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function**: A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. It consists of a name, a set of parameters (optional), and a code block that defines the task to be performed. Functions allow you to break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code modular, reusable, and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example of a function definition in Python:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def greet(name):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello,\", name)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Call**: A function call, also known as invoking or executing a function, is the act of instructing the program to execute the code within a particular function. When you call a function, you're telling the program to run the code defined within that function with specific arguments (if any). This is done by using the function's name followed by parentheses, optionally containing the required arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example of calling the `greet` function defined above:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    greet(\"Alice\")\n",

    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python program, there is typically only one global scope, which exists throughout the entire program. This global scope includes variables, functions, classes, and other objects defined at the top level of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scopes, on the other hand, are created whenever a function is called. Each function call creates its own local scope, which is separate from the global scope and any other local scopes. Variables defined within a function are local to that function and are only accessible within that function's scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the number of global scopes in a Python program is generally one, while the number of local scopes can vary depending on the number of function calls made during the program execution. Each function call creates its own local scope, and when the function returns, its local scope is destroyed.\n"

   "source": [
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function call returns, the local scope associated with that function is destroyed. This means that any variables defined within the function's local scope cease to exist once the function finishes executing and returns control to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variable Lifespan: Variables defined within the function's local scope exist only as long as the function is executing. Once the function completes its execution and returns a value (if any), the local scope, along with all its variables, is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Deallocation: When the local scope is destroyed, the memory allocated for the variables within that scope is released. This memory becomes available for other parts of the program to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable Accessibility: Variables defined within the local scope of a function are not accessible outside of that function. Once the function returns, attempts to access these variables from outside the function will result in a NameError or similar error indicating that the variable is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function Call Stack: As each function call creates its own local scope, these scopes are typically organized in a stack-like structure known as the call stack. When a function returns, its local scope is popped off the call stack, and the program resumes execution from the point where the function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Variables in a local scope exist only temporarily during the execution of a function call, and they are automatically destroyed when the function returns. This behavior helps in managing memory efficiently and prevents unintended side effects from variables lingering in memory after their intended use.\n"

    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a return value refers to the value that a function produces and provides back to the caller when the function is executed. In many programming languages, including Python, functions can optionally return a value using the `return` statement. This allows functions to perform calculations, process data, or perform other tasks and then pass the result back to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Output**: A return value is the output of a function. It represents the result of the function's computation or operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Passing**: Return values are a means for functions to communicate with the rest of the program by passing data back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usefulness**: Return values allow functions to be more flexible and reusable. They enable functions to perform tasks and produce results that can be used by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional**: Not all functions need to return a value. Some functions may only perform actions (such as printing output to the console) without producing a specific result. In such cases, the `return` statement is not required, or the function may explicitly return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is possible to have a return value in an expression. In Python and many other programming languages, you can directly use the return value of a function within an expression. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add(3, 5)  # Here, the return value of the add function is used in an assignment statement\n",
    "total = result + 10  # The return value is used in an arithmetic expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, `add(3, 5)` is a function call that returns a value (in this case, the sum of 3 and 5). This return value is then used in an arithmetic expression (`result + 10`) to perform further computation."

    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function in Python does not have a return statement, or if it reaches the end of its code block without encountering a return statement, the function implicitly returns `None`. `None` is a special built-in constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n",

    "\n",

    "print(global_variable)  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- We then modify the value of `global_variable` by adding `5` to it within the function.\n",
    "- When we call the function and then print the value of `global_variable` outside the function, it reflects the updated value (`15`) because the function modified the global variable directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use the `global` keyword judiciously because it can make code harder to understand and maintain by introducing dependencies between different parts of the program. In many cases, it's preferable to pass variables as arguments to functions rather than relying on global variables.\n"
